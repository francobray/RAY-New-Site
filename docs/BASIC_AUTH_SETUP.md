# Basic Authentication Setup

Simple HTTP Basic Authentication for internal employee pages.

## Overview

The website uses **HTTP Basic Authentication** to protect internal routes. This is a simple, no-dependencies solution that requires just a username and password.

## Features

- üîê Simple username/password authentication
- üöÄ No external dependencies or services
- ‚ö° Edge-compatible middleware
- üõ°Ô∏è Protects `/internal` routes
- üîß Easy to configure

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Basic Authentication Credentials
INTERNAL_AUTH_USER=your-username
INTERNAL_AUTH_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

**Important:** Choose a strong password! This will be shared with your team.

### 2. Set Up Production Environment

Add the same variables to your production environment (Vercel, Railway, etc.):

```bash
INTERNAL_AUTH_USER=admin
INTERNAL_AUTH_PASSWORD=<strong-password-here>
```

### 3. Test It

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/internal`
3. Browser will show a login dialog
4. Enter your username and password
5. You're in! üéâ

## How It Works

1. User visits `/internal` (or any protected route)
2. Middleware checks for `Authorization` header
3. If missing ‚Üí browser shows login dialog (401 response)
4. User enters credentials
5. Browser sends credentials with each request
6. Middleware validates against environment variables
7. ‚úÖ Valid ‚Üí access granted
8. ‚ùå Invalid ‚Üí shows login dialog again

## Protected Routes

Currently protected:
- `/internal` - C√≥digos Trivia (c√≥digo redemption page)

### Add More Protected Routes

Edit `middleware.ts` line 56:

```typescript
const protectedPaths = ['/internal', '/admin', '/dashboard']
```

Any path containing these strings will be protected.

## File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx              # Protected internal page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts                 # Basic auth logic
```

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Good For:
- Internal tools and dashboards
- Small teams (shared credentials)
- Development/staging environments
- Quick protections

### ‚ùå Not Ideal For:
- Individual user tracking
- Role-based permissions
- Public-facing authentication
- Large teams (credentials spread too widely)

### Security Best Practices:

1. **Use HTTPS in production** (automatic on Vercel)
2. **Choose a strong password** (16+ characters, random)
3. **Don't commit `.env.local`** (it's in `.gitignore`)
4. **Rotate credentials** when employees leave
5. **Use a password manager** to share credentials securely
6. **Consider IP whitelisting** for extra security

## Production Deployment

### Vercel

1. Go to project settings
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Add:
   - `INTERNAL_AUTH_USER`
   - `INTERNAL_AUTH_PASSWORD`
4. Redeploy

### Other Platforms

Set environment variables according to your platform's documentation.

## Default Credentials

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** If you don't set environment variables, the default credentials are:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

**ALWAYS change these in production!**

## How to Change Credentials

1. Update `.env.local` (local)
2. Update environment variables in your hosting platform
3. Redeploy (or restart if needed)

No code changes required!

## Sharing Credentials with Team

### Secure Methods:
- ‚úÖ Use a password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- ‚úÖ Share via encrypted messaging (Signal)
- ‚úÖ In-person communication

### Insecure Methods:
- ‚ùå Email
- ‚ùå Slack/Teams messages
- ‚ùå Text messages
- ‚ùå Sticky notes üòÑ

## Browser Behavior

### First Visit:
- Browser shows login dialog
- Enter credentials
- Click "Sign In" or press Enter

### Subsequent Visits:
- Browser remembers credentials
- Automatic login

### Sign Out:
- Close all browser windows
- Or clear browsing data
- Or use incognito/private mode

**Note:** Basic Auth doesn't have a "sign out" button. The browser stores credentials until cleared.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Internal Page

**Solution:** Check that:
1. `.env.local` exists with correct variables
2. You restarted the dev server after creating `.env.local`
3. You're using the correct username and password

### Wrong Credentials

**Browser shows login dialog again**

Clear your browser's cached credentials:
1. Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data ‚Üí Passwords
2. Firefox: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear History ‚Üí Active Logins
3. Safari: Safari ‚Üí Clear History

Or use Incognito/Private mode to test.

### Production Not Working

**Cause:** Environment variables not set  
**Solution:** 
1. Check your hosting platform's environment variables
2. Ensure `INTERNAL_AUTH_USER` and `INTERNAL_AUTH_PASSWORD` are set
3. Redeploy

## Testing Different Credentials

Use `curl` to test:

```bash
# Wrong credentials
curl -u wronguser:wrongpass http://localhost:3000/internal
# Should return: 401 Authentication required

# Correct credentials
curl -u admin:password http://localhost:3000/internal
# Should return: 200 OK with page content
```

## Upgrading to Better Auth

If you need:
- Individual user accounts
- User management
- Role-based access
- OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Session management

Consider upgrading to:
- **NextAuth.js** - Full-featured auth for Next.js
- **Clerk** - Drop-in authentication platform
- **Auth0** - Enterprise authentication
- **Supabase Auth** - Open source alternative

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INTERNAL_AUTH_USER` | No | `admin` | Username for basic auth |
| `INTERNAL_AUTH_PASSWORD` | No | `password` | Password for basic auth |

## FAQ

**Q: Can multiple people use the same credentials?**  
A: Yes! Basic auth uses shared credentials. Everyone uses the same username/password.

**Q: Can I have different credentials for different pages?**  
A: Not with this simple setup. All protected routes use the same credentials. For different permissions, you'd need to upgrade to a full auth system.

**Q: How secure is this?**  
A: Over HTTPS, it's reasonably secure for internal tools. The credentials are base64 encoded (not encrypted) but transmitted over TLS. Not suitable for sensitive data or public-facing auth.

**Q: Can I disable auth for development?**  
A: Yes! Just don't set the environment variables in `.env.local`, or set them to empty strings.

**Q: How do I add more users?**  
A: Basic auth doesn't support multiple users. Everyone shares the same credentials. For individual accounts, upgrade to NextAuth.js or similar.
