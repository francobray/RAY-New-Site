      answer: "We set up most restaurants within a week. You'll have an onboarding specialist to guide you through the process."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you take over my POS?",
      answer: "No, but we can automatically inject orders into many of the major POS systems."
    },

      question: "What happens to my current website?",
      answer: "RAY replaces your current website. We redirect your domain to your new website with RAY."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you do social media marketing?",
      answer: "No. We've found that social media isn't great ROI for most local restaurants. Google search is proven to drive direct sales."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you get customers to order directly from me?",
      answer: "We help you educate your customers and set up reward programs so customers earn points when they order direct."
